# NLP---Emotion-Classification-in-Text
Objective: 
Develop machine learning models to classify emotions in text samples
1. Loading and Preprocessing 
Load the dataset and perform necessary preprocessing steps. 
2. Feature Extraction 
Implement feature extraction using CountVectorizer or TfidfVectorizer. Describe how the chosen method transforms the text data into numerical features.
3. Model Development 
Train the following machine learning models
a)Naive Bayes
b)Support Vector Machine 
5. Model Comparison 
Evaluate the model using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, F1-score).
